# FlutterQuizGame
## About the project
I learn Flutter in my free time. This is a Quiz app, that I made on my own!
I had to make a few visits to Google, but I did it!
## About the repo
These are just the files in the lib folder, and the pubspec.yaml

If you want to run this app on your device, you have to make a new flutter project and insert all the files in the lib folder, except the pubspec.yaml. For that, just replace the automatically generated one.

Hope you like It!
